## A Genome Scale Metabolic Reconstruction of *Desulfovibrio vulgaris*

*Desulfovibrio vulgaris* is a bacterium with remarkable flexible metabolism. It can grow on multiple different substrates on its own, or in co-cultures with methanogenic archaea. 

### Growth Simulations

A collection of scripts that simulate growth of *D. vugarlis* on 4 different media conditions. Each script alters the model to grow under the specified condition,conducts the growth simulation, and returns the flux solution and the altered model. Additionally, each script prints out major metabolite uptake and production fluxes, including the predicted rate of cell growth.
